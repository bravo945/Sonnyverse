<p>[[PRE-FLASH]] - [[WORLD WAR 3]] The Vanguard projects were a set of
military projects revolving around using the recent boom in advanced
technologies to create new and powerful military inventions in World War
3. The most recognizable projects from this set are [[ACIS]], Which used
artificial intelligence for interconnected Arial and terrestrial battle
systems, and the <a href="SEAL.md">S.E.A.L.</a>, which created power

battleground.</p>
