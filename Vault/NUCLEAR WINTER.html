<p>[[POST-FLASH]] #### 2045 - 2051</p>
<p>Nuclear Winter was a period beginning shortly after the Flash, in
which ash and debris from the nuclear holocaust rose into the atmosphere
and blocking out the sun, causing dangerously low temperatures for
around 6 years. A ruthless era, the winter strained survivors, forcing
even the most prepped to their limits. What was left of the population
post nuclear winter would be forever changed, battle-hardened, and ready
to explore the beginning of the post-modern world.</p>

<p>Shortly after the bombs fell, many survivors heard tales of beasts
hunting and slaughtering lonely survivors. Regarded by nonsense by most,
this ignorance would become a catalyst for insane numbers under the
RAD-X disease</p>
