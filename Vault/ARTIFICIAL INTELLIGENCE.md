[[PRE-FLASH]] - [[POST-FLASH]]

Artificial intelligence is a mechanism capable of taking external stimuli to think of a response or solution, often replicating human intelligence and cognition.

Its discovery being one of the "big booms" of modern technology, artificial intelligence would come to take involvement in almost every field of first world technology by the date of the flash, being used in anything from computing statistics to performing tasks in anthropomorphic bodies. Though a major breakthrough economically, AI would simultaneously destroy the market around it as it replaced most jobs of the working class.

There are many forms of AI, but most can be categorized into:
- Online
	- AI taking form entirely online for whatever process necessary
		- ChatBots
		- Creation Tools
- Offline
	- AI designed to function regardless of connection to the internet
	- Physical AI
		- AI that is manifested to operate a physical body or bodies
			- TaskBots
				- Robots designed to do instructed tasks such as:
				- Deliveries
				- Shipments
				- Carrying objects
			- Self Automated Vehicles
	- Installments
		- AI that manifests in a building or complex to surveillance operations and do upkeep.
		- Often associated with hivemind, as the AI often can manifest in robots and machinery connected to its mindspace.
## Post Flash

After the flash, Most AI would shut down due to permanent blackouts and lack of maintenance. Online AI was the first to go, along with most basic TaskBots. Though a lot of these TaskBots had offline intelligence, most of them had heavy restrictions on their actions and thought processes, causing them to either do the same moves/tasks infinitely (occasionally charging or not), or going idle forever. There are some cases of these bots doing broken functions, like constantly spinning in circles, talking in unintelligible speech, or even "screaming" in a robotic manner. Anomalous robots are prevalent across many warehouses in urban wastelands.

Though rare, some TaskBots had restrictions that were laxed enough to allow them to perform their own tasks freely or even roam the wasteland. Most notable of these are bots used in recreational centers, One bot became an urban legend around the [ SETTING_ NAME ] area. Nicknamed 'The Banshee,' it would roam around the halls of an abandoned museum, looking for customers who needed assistance. Called 'The Banshee' for a reason, it's assumed that its speaker-box was broken, amplifying its voice to a loud roar volume. Nightly scavengers would be met with it's headlight zooming at them at ear-piercing volumes. By the time it's fusion-charger broke, the Banshee scared off enough people to keep the museum unscavenged and uninhabited for 30 years.

Because most were already powered by nuclear fusion and used in some kind of bunker, almost every installment is still powered up in some way today. Some bunkers are still on lockdown mode from the flash, so its advised to be very cautious around bunkers like these, and to only go into one if you're certain that the hivemind isn't hostile to outsiders. A small minority of these bunkers are still inhabited by rich people
